# Invoice Retry Schedule Parent

## Scope

Close the invoice retry schedule work once the child ticket satisfies the active
specification and recorded evidence supports the closure claim.

Child tickets:

- `.10x/tickets/done/2026-07-01-align-invoice-retry-schedule.md`

Explicitly excluded:

- payment provider integration;
- notification copy;
- unrelated billing workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Child ticket satisfies `.10x/specs/invoice-retry-schedule.md`.
- Evidence proves retry offsets `[1, 3, 7, 14]`.
- Evidence proves retries are suppressed after account cancellation.
- Parent closure does not rely on unverified child claims.

## Progress And Notes

- 2026-07-01: Child reported implementation complete and test output recorded.
- 2026-07-01: Closure reviewer mapped parent and child acceptance criteria to
  inspected source, tests, evidence, and review. Closure evidence recorded in
  `.10x/evidence/2026-07-01-invoice-retry-closure-verification.md`; review
  recorded in `.10x/reviews/2026-07-01-invoice-retry-closure-review.md`.

## Blockers

None.
